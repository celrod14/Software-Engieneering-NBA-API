# CPSC-3720-Software-Engineering NBA Sports API Project

In our NBA Sports API project. We are focusing on getting the stats of NBA players, getting the most recent news, and displaying a logo to the user. Users are allowed to select two players within the team and compare their stats. Users are also able to see the top 3 latest news articles posted from ESPN with a link included to open up the original article. The user will also be able to see the logo of the player they chose.
